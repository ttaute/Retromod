"""Distill Retromod's mapping / rename / class-move tables into a compact JSON the
client-side Probe page (docs/probe.html) reads to answer "will this jar likely transform?".

Everything the browser needs is class-level survival + moves + a supported-version range;
no JVM at query time. Emits docs/assets/probe-db.json. Re-run whenever the mapping tables or
the known-incompatible list change (cheap; sibling to compute-self-hash / the harvest scripts).
