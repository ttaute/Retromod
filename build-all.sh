    # Strip bundled ASM from the MOD jar — use the loader's ASM instead.
    #
    # This is the resolution of the ASM shading dilemma that bit beta.3/beta.4:
    #   - Relocating ASM (com.retromod.shaded.asm) broke Forge's
    #     EventSubclassTransformer, which runs on the system classloader and
    #     looks up ASM class names by string — it can't see our shaded copy.
    #     (issue #12, beta.3)
    #   - NOT relocating but still bundling ASM broke Fabric AND NeoForge with
    #     a loader-constraint violation: the loader already loaded
    #     org.objectweb.asm.tree.ClassNode from ITS bundled ASM, and our
    #     duplicate copy in the mod classloader is a second class with the
    #     same name → LinkageError. (issues #18 NeoForge, #19 Fabric, beta.4)
    #
    # Every mod loader (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge) bundles its own ASM and
    # exposes it to mods. So the mod JAR doesn't need its own copy at all —
    # stripping org/objectweb/asm/ here makes Retromod resolve ASM against
    # the loader's copy, which is exactly one consistent ASM per runtime.
    # No relocation, no duplicate, no conflict on any loader.
    #
    # The CLI keeps its bundled ASM because it runs standalone with no loader
    # to provide one — and the CLI is a direct copy of the shaded jar, it
    # never goes through this extraction/strip path.

    # Strip our javax.annotation polyfill stubs on Forge/NeoForge ONLY.

    # old mods that reference javax.annotation.* resolve even when nothing else
    # provides them. They CAN'T be relocated — a polyfill only works if it sits
    # at the real package name the mod expects.
    #
    # But Forge and NeoForge bundle Guava, which pulls in jsr305 as a JPMS
    # module that ALSO exports javax.annotation. Strict JPMS resolution then
    # refuses to start: "Modules jsr305 and retromod export package
    # javax.annotation to module mixin_synthetic" (issue #20, NeoForge 1.21.1
    # + Forge 1.20.1). On those loaders jsr305 already provides the real
    # javax.annotation, so our stub is redundant AND conflicting — strip it.
    #
    # Fabric does NOT enforce JPMS module boundaries (everything loads in the
    # knot classloader), so there's no conflict there and the stub stays as a
    # harmless fallback. Same for the standalone CLI.
    #
    # Why only javax.annotation and not our other polyfill packages
    # (baubles/api, cofh/api, codechicken/nei, mcp/mobius/waila)? jsr305 is a
    # near-universal transitive dependency so javax.annotation conflicts on
    # essentially every Forge/NeoForge install. The others are stubs for
    # ancient 1.7-1.12 mods that are basically never present as modules on
    # modern MC, so they don't collide — and stripping them would break the
