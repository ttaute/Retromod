# Changelog

All user-facing changes to Retromod. The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are [semver](https://semver.org/) with the `1.0.0-beta.N` series leading up to stable 1.0.

## [1.0.0-beta.6] — 2026-05-20

Another JPMS-conflict hotfix, this time for `javax.annotation`. Same family as the Gson (beta.3) and ASM (beta.5) conflicts — a bundled package colliding with a loader-provided module on Forge/NeoForge.

### Fixed

- **Forge + NeoForge crash on launch: `Modules jsr305 and retromod export package javax.annotation to module mixin_synthetic`.** We bundle `javax/annotation/{Nullable,Nonnull}` polyfill stubs so old mods referencing those annotations resolve. But Forge and NeoForge bundle Guava, which transitively provides `jsr305` as a JPMS module that also exports `javax.annotation` — and strict JPMS refuses two modules exporting the same package. Reported by @epiktechno on NeoForge 1.21.1 + Forge 1.20.1 (#20). The stub can't be relocated (a polyfill only works at the real package name), so `build-all.sh` now strips `javax/annotation/` from the Forge and NeoForge per-loader mod JARs — jsr305 provides the real ones there. Fabric keeps the stub (no JPMS enforcement, so no conflict; it stays as a harmless fallback) and so does the standalone CLI.

### Note

This is the third package in the bundled-dependency-vs-loader-module conflict family (Gson → relocate, ASM → strip, javax.annotation → strip on Forge/NeoForge). The remaining bundled polyfill packages (baubles/api, cofh/api, codechicken/nei, mcp/mobius/waila) are stubs for ancient 1.7–1.12 mods that are essentially never present as JPMS modules on modern MC, so they don't collide — left in place so the polyfill still works for the rare user translating one of those.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] — 2026-05-19

Hotfix for ASM classloader conflicts that beta.4 introduced on Fabric and NeoForge. **Everyone on beta.4 should upgrade** — beta.4 crashes on launch on Fabric and NeoForge.

### Fixed

- **Fabric + NeoForge crash on launch with ASM `LinkageError` / loader-constraint violation.** beta.4 un-relocated ASM to fix a Forge problem (the `EventSubclassTransformer` issue, #12), but that made the bundled ASM collide with the loader's own ASM: Fabric and NeoForge each bundle ASM and load `org.objectweb.asm.tree.ClassNode` in their classloader, so our duplicate copy in the mod classloader is a second class with the same name → `LinkageError`. Reported by @Derpgamer22 / @Rivmo / @LwkySad (#18, NeoForge) and @berwulf / @benio1394 (#19, Fabric).
- **Root cause, properly fixed this time:** the mod JAR no longer bundles ASM at all. Every mod loader (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge) provides its own ASM and exposes it to mods, so Retromod just uses the loader's copy — exactly one ASM per runtime, no relocation, no duplicate, no conflict on any loader. `build-all.sh` strips `org/objectweb/asm/` from each per-loader mod JAR. The standalone CLI keeps its bundled ASM (it has no loader to borrow one from). This resolves the beta.3-vs-beta.4 flip-flop where relocating broke Forge and not-relocating broke Fabric/NeoForge — neither was right; the answer was to not ship ASM in the mod at all.

### Note

If you tested beta.4 and it crashed on Fabric/NeoForge, that's this bug. beta.5 is the fix. The classtweaker, NeoForge-loaderVersion, and Forge-AOT fixes from beta.4 are all still here — beta.5 only adds the ASM-stripping on top.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] — 2026-05-19

Bug-fix release closing out the wave of beta.2/beta.3 issue reports from the early-Modrinth-publish users. Three independent fixes; everyone running beta.2 or beta.3 should upgrade.

### Fixed

- **Forge: AOT crash with `Could not find parent com/retromod/shaded/asm/signature/SignatureVisitor`.** Beta.3's ASM relocation broke Forge's `EventSubclassTransformer`, which runs on the system `AppClassLoader` and looked up the relocated ASM classes by string — but those classes only existed in Retromod's mod-classloader. Every Forge transform pass failed. **Un-relocated ASM** (kept Gson, SLF4J, and toml4j relocated — those are what actually conflict with Forge's JPMS module resolver). Reported by @No11290 on issue #12.
- **NeoForge: `needs language provider java:26.1 or above to load, we have found 11.0`.** `loaderVersion` in `neoforge.mods.toml` is the **FancyModLoader** version, not the NeoForge version. Our `build-all.sh` was setting it to the MC-version-based number (`[26.1,)` for MC 26.1, etc.) — which doesn't match anything because FML versions don't track MC versions (FML 11.x ships with MC 26.1 NeoForge). Changed to permissive `[1,)`; the actual NeoForge version constraint is in the `[[dependencies.retromod]] modId = "neoforge"` block and is unchanged. Reported by @Derpgamer22 (#9) and @maksmanus (#10).
- **Fabric: `Failed to read classTweaker file from mod X / Namespace mismatch` crash on launch.** Mods built for one MC era ship classtweaker / accesswidener files with a namespace header (`intermediary` or `official`) that doesn't match the host MC's runtime namespace. The existing remapper only handled `intermediary → official` (so a 1.21.x mod on a 26.1 runtime worked); the reverse direction silently failed and Fabric Loader crashed at launch with `ClassTweakerFormatException`. New behavior: strip the `classTweakers` and `accessWidener` declarations from the mod's `fabric.mod.json` during transformation. The mod loses whatever class-opening the classtweaker provided (some mixin targets may now fail to find their hooks), but the mod *loads* instead of killing the game. That's the correct tradeoff for old-mod-on-new-MC. Reported across issues #11, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17 against satin, azurelib, tidal, dsurround, rubinated_nether, immersive_aircraft, comforts, moonlight, supplementaries.

### Notes for the issue reporters

- **#9, #10 (NeoForge)** — fixed by the loaderVersion change. Re-download beta.4 and the JPMS error goes away.
- **#11 (4 mods on Fabric 26.1.2)** — three of those mods (immersive_aircraft, comforts, moonlight, supplementaries) likely had classtweaker dependencies via their depend chain; the strip should unblock them. Worth re-testing.
- **#12 (1.12.2 mods on 1.20.1 Forge)** — the ASM unrelocation should fix the SignatureVisitor crash; 1.12.2 → 1.20.1 is still a massive hop, so individual content mods may have other issues, but at least the AOT pipeline runs to completion.
- **#13, #14, #15, #16, #17** — directly fixed by the classtweaker strip.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] — 2026-05-18

Single-purpose hotfix release. **Only difference from beta.2 is the shaded-dependency relocation** — no other code changes, no new features.

### Fixed

- **Forge 1.20.1+ "Modules retromod and com.google.gson export package X to module minecraft" crash on launch.** The shaded fat JAR bundled Gson, SLF4J, and toml4j without relocation, so Forge's strict JPMS module resolver saw two modules claiming to export the same package to `minecraft` and refused to start. Every bundled dependency is now relocated under `com.retromod.shaded.*` (ASM was already done, this round adds Gson, SLF4J, and toml4j). Fabric/Quilt/NeoForge builds weren't crashing but received the same relocation for consistency and future-proofing.

If you're on beta.2 and the mod loads for you fine, beta.3 is bytes-different but behavior-identical — no urgency to upgrade. If you're on beta.2 and you hit the JPMS crash above (Forge 1.20.x specifically), beta.3 is the fix.

---

## [1.0.0-beta.2] — 2026-05-17

This release focused on **broadening the Java + loader-version range so the right Retromod build is actually loadable on every MC version we publish**, plus carrying the security/quality improvements from the past few weeks.

### Fixed

- **Java requirement now matches each MC version.** Retromod's compiled bytecode targets Java 17 (was Java 25 in beta.1, which silently required all users to be on Java 25 regardless of MC version). The same JAR runs on Java 17, 21, and 25 — `build-all.sh` now declares the appropriate per-MC `"java"` constraint in `fabric.mod.json`: `>=17` for MC 1.20–1.20.4, `>=21` for MC 1.20.5–1.21.x, `>=25` for MC 26.x. This directly fixes the GitHub issue where MC 1.20.1 + Java 17 was rejected ([reported on the issue tracker](https://github.com/Bownlux/Retromod/issues)).
- **Forge `loaderVersion` is now correct per MC version.** beta.1 hardcoded `[52,)` which silently rejected every Forge build for MC 1.20.x (Forge 47–50). The MC 1.20.1/1.20.2/1.20.4 Forge builds couldn't actually load on the user's Forge. `build-all.sh` now maps MC → Forge loader version (e.g. MC 1.20.1 → Forge 47).
- **NeoForge `loaderVersion` is now correct per MC version.** Same pattern — beta.1 had a hardcoded `[4,)` minimum that didn't match NeoForge's actual versioning (`20.2.x` for MC 1.20.2, `21.0.x` for MC 1.21, etc.). Now per-MC.
- **`issueTrackerURL` in build-all.sh** pointed at the old `MC-Retromod` repo name in Forge/NeoForge metadata. Now correctly points at `Retromod`.
- **Duplicate "Made by the Developers of revivalsmp.net" line** in Forge and NeoForge mod descriptions (sandwich top + bottom) is now a single line at the end, matching the Fabric description.

### Added

- **`quilt.mod.json`** so Quilt Loader sees Retromod as a first-class Quilt mod (icon and metadata in Quilt's mod list, instead of being shown as a Fabric-mod-loaded-via-compat). Same Fabric JAR, no separate "Quilt build" needed — Quilt Loader runs Fabric mods natively.
- **SRG → Mojang member-name remap** for old reobf'd Forge mods. Forge 64.x dropped the SRG remap layer for MC 26.1; Retromod now provides the dictionary (~120 starter entries; expandable via `src/main/resources/retromod/srg-to-mojang.tsv` — see [Adding SRG Mappings](https://bownlux.github.io/Retromod/srg-mappings) in the docs).
- **CHANGELOG.md** (this file).
- **Documentation:** new pages for "Mods That Can't Be Translated" and "Adding SRG Mappings", new FAQ entries about Quilt support and Retromod's offline-by-default network policy.

### Security

- **AutoFix engine opt-in flag is now honored on Forge and NeoForge entry points too.** beta.1 gated the crash-log parser behind `-Dretromod.autoFix=true` on Fabric only; the Forge/NeoForge entry points ran it unconditionally. A malicious mod that emitted a crafted log line through SLF4J could have caused Retromod to register attacker-chosen method/field redirects in the shared transformer. Fixed across all three loader entry points.
- **JIJ (Jar-in-Jar) extraction** in `FabricModTransformer.processNestedJiJJar` is now bounded against zip-bomb-style nested archives. Previously, an inner JAR that lied about its compressed-vs-decompressed size could expand to arbitrary size during transform.
- **Output JAR write paths** in `AotCompiler` and `ApiEmbedder` now validate entry names via `ZipSecurity.safeEntryName(...)` to stop input-side zip-slip payloads from propagating into output JARs (where a downstream tool extracting them would have inherited the vulnerability).
- **Resource-pack and data-pack extraction** in `ResourcePackTransformer`, `DataPackTransformer`, and `QuiltModTransformer` now use the bounded `ZipSecurity.copyBounded` helper instead of unbounded `Files.copy(InputStream, Path)`.
- **`SignatureVerifier` no longer uses XOR-obfuscated strings.** The fork-detection notice template was previously stored as a XOR-encoded byte array and decoded at runtime — a textbook malware-scanner pattern even though the content was benign. Replaced with a plain string constant; the soft anti-tamper trade-off wasn't worth the scanner flag.
- **`Premain-Class` / `Agent-Class` / `Can-Redefine-Classes` manifest entries** are no longer in the main mod JAR or the shaded CLI fat JAR — only in the dedicated `-agent.jar` classifier (which exists for explicit `-javaagent` use). The mod JAR no longer advertises JVM-class-hijack capability it doesn't use.
- **All three `Runtime.exec(new String[]{"xdg-open", url})` browser-launch fallbacks** are removed. `Desktop.isDesktopSupported()` is the primary path on every system Minecraft runs on; if it fails, users now get a dialog with the URL to copy instead of a process-exec fallback. The codebase has zero `Runtime.exec` calls now.

### Changed

- **Project is named "Retromod" (capital R only)** throughout the codebase, docs, and metadata. The previous "RetroMod" (capital R + capital M) casing was a typo on my part that propagated for a while. All class names, comments, log output, READMEs, and docs are now consistent. The GitHub repo and Modrinth project have been renamed to match.
- **Network policy is offline by default.** Retromod never reaches the internet on its own — no telemetry, no auto-update checks, no silent downloads. Optional Modrinth native-version lookup is gated behind a config flag; the CLI's `archive download` command prompts before any HTTP request.
- **`fabric.mod.json` and `quilt.mod.json` now use `${project.version}`** via Maven resource filtering, so future version bumps only need to touch `pom.xml`.
- **Per-loader output JARs from `build-all.sh` are now properly metadata-stripped:** the Fabric build contains `fabric.mod.json` AND `quilt.mod.json` (so it works on both Fabric and Quilt loaders); the Forge build contains only `mods.toml`; the NeoForge build contains only `neoforge.mods.toml`. No more "multi-loader fat JAR" being shipped where one loader's mod scanner might trip over another loader's metadata.

### Known limitations (unchanged from beta.1)

- Deep-integration mods (Create, Applied Energistics 2, Tinkers' Construct, IndustrialCraft, OptiFine, etc.) will not work — see the [Mods That Can't Be Translated](https://bownlux.github.io/Retromod/incompatible-mods) page for the full list and the general "if a mod uses X" rules.
- Server software (Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Purpur) is not supported — Retromod targets the *mod loaders*, not server plugin platforms. Plugin support is planned but development has not started yet.
