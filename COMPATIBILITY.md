# Retromod Compatibility List

> **Retromod v1.0.0-beta.1** | **Target: Minecraft 26.1** | **Fabric Loader 0.18.4**
>
> Last updated: 2026-03-10

Retromod enables older Fabric mods to run on newer Minecraft versions by applying bytecode transformations.
It covers MC **1.14.4 through 1.21.11** with 31 Fabric shims, 317+ method redirects, and 486+ class redirects.

All mods listed here were downloaded exclusively from **[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)** (a curated, reviewed mod repository).

> **About the `*` on entries below:** "Successfully transformed" in this document means **the mod's bytecode passed Retromod's pipeline and the mod loader accepts it on the target MC version** — i.e. it loads. It does **not** mean every in-game feature works. In practice **most mods on this list only get to the loading stage** — Minecraft starts, the mod registers, log lines for it appear — but specific features (rendering hooks, mixin injections, registry-keyed accessors, NBT round-trips, etc.) commonly fail at runtime once they're actually exercised. Each entry below is marked with `*` to make that limitation explicit. Closing those runtime gaps is what Retromod's beta phase is for; if you hit a broken feature in a listed mod, please [file an issue with the log](https://github.com/Bownlux/Retromod/issues).

## Mods That Load After Transformation*

All mods below were transformed using the Retromod CLI (`retromod batch`) and have their version constraints
relaxed to load on MC 1.21.11. They are sorted by original MC version (oldest first).

> **`*` (only to the loading stage):** every entry here passes the load, but in-game functionality varies and is **not guaranteed** for any specific mod. See the note above the section.

## Recommended Test Setup (21 mods simultaneously)*

These mods were selected to run together (one per unique mod, picking the oldest version). Same `*` caveat as above — the set loads, but individual feature-level functionality isn't guaranteed for any of them yet.

## Mods That Can Never Be Translated

The mods below sit in a category separate from "skipped this run." They can't be made to work by any automated bytecode translator — Retromod or otherwise — and never will be. The full reasoning, the general rules behind the list, and the difference between "won't load" and "loads but features are broken" lives on its own page: **[Mods That Can't Be Translated](https://bownlux.github.io/Retromod/incompatible-mods)**.

The short version:

| Mod | Why it's a hard "no" |
|---|---|
| **Create** | Ships Flywheel (custom GL-level rendering library) and rewrites internals between MC versions. |
| **Applied Energistics 2 (AE2)** | Deep MC integration, custom networking protocol, channel/quantum systems re-architected each version. |
| **Tinkers' Construct** | Tool/material system replaced at JSON-schema *and* bytecode level; schemas change too much to redirect. |
| **IndustrialCraft / IC2** | Coremod heritage, energy network internals tied to MC's tick scheduler. |
| **Thaumcraft** | Aspect/research data tied to MC internals; multiple full redesigns. |
| **OptiFine** | Proprietary, closed-source, Forge coremod — license + technical reasons both block translation. |
| **Sodium / Iris / Embeddium / Flywheel** | Replace MC's rendering pipeline; mixin injections target bytecode offsets that move between versions. They may *load* but full functionality is not realistic. |

**The general rule.** Any mod that uses native code (`.so` / `.dll` / `.dylib` files), ships its own bytecode transformer (coremod), uses a custom or modified Mixin framework, replaces MC's rendering pipeline, or interacts with MC at byte-level GPU buffers will **never** be translatable by any automated tool. See the [Mods That Can't Be Translated](https://bownlux.github.io/Retromod/incompatible-mods) page for the full breakdown.

## Skipped Mods

These were skipped in a specific test run for solvable reasons (missing dependencies, deprecated standalone versions, etc.), not because they're permanently incompatible. Different from the "never" list above.

| Mod | Version | MC | Reason |
|-----|---------|-----|--------|
| **LambDynamicLights** | 1.3.4 | 1.16.5 | Needs SpruceUI dependency |
| **Light Overlay** | 7.0.3 | 1.19.4 | Needs Architectury API |
| **Essential** | 1.3.10.6 | 1.20.1 | 50MB, heavily obfuscated, proprietary |
| **Litematica** | 0.19.60 | 1.21 | Needs malilib dependency |
| **Freecam** | 1.3.5 | 1.18.2 | Very old, many API changes |
| **Presence Footsteps** | 1.8.2 | ? | No MC version in metadata |
| **Zoomify** (old) | 1.1.0 | 1.18.0 | Very old, use 2.15.2 instead |

---

## Resource Packs

| Resource Pack | MC Version | Status |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Fresh Moves v3.1.1** (Animated Eyes) | 1.21.3+ | Fixed - added `min_format`/`max_format` fields |
| **Fresh Animations v1** (1.10.3 BETA) | 1.20.3+ | Works natively with overlays |

---

## Data Packs

No custom data packs were tested. Retromod can transform data packs in world save `datapacks/` folders.

---

## Batch Transformation Results

Total mods processed via CLI: **45 mods from Modrinth**

| Result | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Bytecode transformed (loaded successfully)* | 36 |
| Copied (already compatible) | 9 |
| Failed at transformation stage | 0 |

**Average transformation time: 209ms per mod**

> `*` "Transformed" here means the bytecode pipeline ran without error and the resulting JAR was accepted by the loader. It does **not** mean the mod runs without runtime errors once gameplay actually exercises its hooks. Most mods on the list have at least one feature that breaks in-game on the new MC version — see the section caveat above.

---

## Version Coverage

Retromod covers every Fabric version from 1.14.4 to 1.21.11:

```
MC 1.14.4 -> 1.15.2 -> 1.16.5 -> 1.17 -> 1.17.1 -> 1.18 -> 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2
-> 1.19 -> 1.19.1 -> 1.19.2 -> 1.19.3 -> 1.19.4 -> 1.20 -> 1.20.1 -> 1.20.2
-> 1.20.3 -> 1.20.4 -> 1.20.5 -> 1.20.6 -> 1.21 -> 1.21.1 -> 1.21.2 -> 1.21.3
-> 1.21.4 -> 1.21.5 -> 1.21.6 -> 1.21.7 -> 1.21.8 -> 1.21.9 -> 1.21.10 -> 1.21.11
```

---

## How to Use

### Method 1: Drop in retromod-input/ (Recommended)
1. Install Retromod in your `mods/` folder
2. Place old `.jar` mods into `mods/retromod-input/`
3. Launch Minecraft - Retromod auto-transforms during pre-launch

### Method 2: CLI Batch Transform
```bash
retromod batch ./old-mods/ --output ./transformed/
```

### Method 3: CLI Single Transform
```bash
retromod transform old-mod.jar --output new-mod-retromod.jar
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Loading vs functioning is a real distinction.** The `*` on every entry in this document means "loads, may not function." A mod showing up in the list above is *not* a guarantee that any specific feature of that mod actually works in-game. We're closing the runtime-functionality gap shim by shim during beta.
2. **Mixin-heavy mods** (Sodium, Iris, Lithium) may have runtime issues beyond bytecode redirection — mixins target specific bytecode positions that often move between MC versions, and a transformer can't synthesize a new injection point that didn't exist before.
3. **Mods needing specific Fabric API submodules** that were renamed/removed may need additional shims.
4. **Very old mods** (1.16.5 and earlier) have the most API changes to bridge — expect more rough edges here than on shorter translation distances.
5. **Kotlin mods** need Fabric Language Kotlin installed separately.
6. **Resource packs** for MC 1.21.11 need `min_format`/`max_format` in `pack.mcmeta`.
