/**
 * A detector for one specific "shape" a mod class might have: a Forge event
 * listener, a {@code DeferredRegister} holder, a BlockEntity-like class, etc.
 *
 * <h3>Why patterns?</h3>
 * <p>Lots of mods implement the same concepts (register blocks, handle events,
 * define block entities) with slightly different code. If we can recognize
 * these concepts structurally (independent of exact class names or parent
 * hierarchies), we get two benefits:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Better diagnostics.</b> A gap report that says "your mod has 7
 *       Forge-event-listener classes" is more actionable than a list of
 *       individual unresolved references.</li>
 *   <li><b>Better adaptation.</b> Future versions can apply targeted fixes
 *       when a pattern is recognized: wire up registries, retarget event
 *       handlers, synthesize stubs. v1 is detection-only.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Contract</h3>
 * <p>Implementations inspect the given {@link ClassNode} and return a
 * {@link PatternMatch} if the class matches the pattern, or {@code null} if
 * it doesn't. Implementations must:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Be read-only.</b> Never mutate the {@code ClassNode}; patterns can
 *       run in any order, and a mutated node would poison subsequent patterns.</li>
 *   <li><b>Be fast.</b> Patterns run on every mod class, so an O(n²) scan of
 *       methods would blow up on large classes. Aim for linear-or-better.</li>
 *   <li><b>Honor the scope filter.</b> If the class isn't in
 *       {@link MatchContext#modOwnClasses()}, patterns should typically return
 *       null immediately, since we don't want to match MC or JDK classes.</li>
 *   <li><b>Be deterministic.</b> Same class + same context always produces the
 *       same match result. This keeps gap reports diff-stable across CI runs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Why {@code ClassNode}, not bytecode?</h3>
 * <p>Patterns need random access to methods, fields, and annotations. The
 * streaming {@code ClassVisitor} API makes that awkward. The tree API's
 * {@code ClassNode} holds everything in memory at once, which is a few KB per
 * class and lets patterns be written as simple loops over {@code cls.methods},
 * {@code cls.fields}, {@code cls.visibleAnnotations}.</p>
