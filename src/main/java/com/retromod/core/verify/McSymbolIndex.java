/**
 * Read-only oracle for "does this class/method/field exist in the target
 * Minecraft version?"
 *
 * <p>This interface is the shared foundation for two features that both need
 * to answer membership questions against the target MC API surface:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ReferenceVerifier} — scans transformed bytecode and reports any
 *       reference the index says doesn't exist.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ReflectionStringRemapper} — before rewriting a reflection LDC
 *       string, can ask the index whether the rewritten target would actually
 *       resolve.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Why an interface (not just a class)?</h3>
 * <p>Testability. The production implementation reads a full Minecraft JAR and
 * can't be exercised in unit tests without shipping ~100MB of test fixtures.
 * With an interface, tests can supply a tiny stub index with just the
 * classes/members the test cares about. It also leaves room for a future
 * runtime-backed implementation that checks against the live classloader
 * instead of a JAR scan.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What counts as "existing"?</h3>
 * <p>"Exists" means the exact member (class by internal name; method by
 * {@code owner + name + descriptor}; field by {@code owner + name + descriptor})
 * is either declared on the target class OR inherited through a superclass/
 * interface chain. So {@code hasMethod("net/minecraft/world/level/Level",
 * "getBlockState", "(...)")} is {@code true} even if {@code getBlockState} is
 * declared on a {@code LevelReader} interface that {@code Level} extends —
 * because that's a legal call site at compile time.</p>
 *
 * <p>"Doesn't exist" simply means "not found in the index." If the index hasn't
 * been populated (e.g., the MC JAR wasn't available), every lookup returns
 * {@code false}. Callers that need to distinguish "not indexed" from "truly
 * missing" should check {@link #isAvailable()} first.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Coverage scope</h3>
 * <p>The index covers what we can authoritatively enumerate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Everything under {@code net/minecraft/**} and {@code com/mojang/**}
 *       in the target MC JAR.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Loader-API renames (Fabric, NeoForge, Forge) are <b>not</b> in this index —
 * those are handled by {@link LoaderApiRenames}, which is a curated hand-maintained
 * table rather than an auto-indexed one. See that class for rationale.</p>
