/**
 * A single MC-API reference that didn't resolve against the target MC version.
 * Produced by {@link ReferenceVerifier} and aggregated into a
 * {@link VerificationReport}.
 *
 * <h3>Field meanings</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Kind} - what kind of miss this is. {@code MISSING_CLASS} is the
 *       most severe because it implies every member reference against that
 *       class is also broken. {@code MISSING_METHOD} / {@code MISSING_FIELD}
 *       mean the owner class exists but the specific member didn't - a classic
 *       signature change or rename. {@code BAD_SIGNATURE} is reserved for
 *       future use (v1 emits it only if a method name exists but no descriptor
 *       variant matches; v1 just flags it as MISSING_METHOD with suggestions
 *       for now).</li>
 *   <li>{@code owner/name/descriptor} - the reference itself, in JVM internal
 *       form. {@code name}/{@code descriptor} are empty strings for
 *       {@code MISSING_CLASS} since only the owner class is the thing that's
 *       missing in that case.</li>
 *   <li>{@code sourceClass/sourceMethod/sourceLine} - where in the mod the
 *       reference came from. {@code sourceLine} is {@code -1} if the class
 *       was compiled without debug info.</li>
 *   <li>{@code suggestions} - up to a handful of candidate replacements that
 *       DO exist in the target MC index. May be empty if no similar names
 *       were found.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Equality and sorting</h3>
 * <p>Records compare by all fields, so two references that differ only in
 * {@code sourceLine} are considered distinct. The cross-mod gap report
 * aggregates on {@link #identityKey()} (owner+name+descriptor+kind) instead -
 * see {@link VerificationReport}.</p>
