/**
 * Mod-author opt-out mechanism.
 *
 * <h3>What this is</h3>
 * <p>Retromod transforms mod bytecode at load time. The end user has every
 * right to do that with their own copy of a mod, and there's no statutory
 * obligation that requires us to ask first. Retromod sits in the same legal
 * frame as Forge, Fabric, Mixin, and OptiFine, none of which ask either.</p>
 *
 * <p>That said, some mod authors have legitimate reasons to prefer their mod
 * NOT be transformed by Retromod:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Paid / Patreon mods where transform-introduced bugs would unfairly
 *       reflect on the author</li>
 *   <li>Mods with explicit "no modification" clauses in their license or
 *       README</li>
 *   <li>Mods built around precise behavior that Retromod's general-purpose
 *       shimming might break in subtle ways</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For those authors, Retromod honors a single, simple opt-out signal: a
 * marker file at <code>META-INF/retromod-opt-out</code> inside the mod's JAR.
 * If present, Retromod skips transformation entirely for that JAR: the JAR
 * passes through untouched to {@code mods/}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>How a mod author opts out</h3>
 * <p>Add an empty file at {@code src/main/resources/META-INF/retromod-opt-out}
 * to the mod's source tree. The build will package it. That's the whole
 * mechanism: no version coordination, no API to track, no API surface to
 * maintain.</p>
 *
 * <h3>How a user can override</h3>
 * <p>Some users may want to force-transform a mod whose author opted out
 * (e.g., to make an abandoned mod work on a newer MC). The override is
 * {@code -Dretromod.honorOptOut=false} on the JVM command line. Default is
 * {@code true} (opt-out is honored).</p>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation choices</h3>
 * <p>The marker file lives at {@code META-INF/}, parallel to {@code mods.toml}
 * and {@code fabric.mod.json}, so it's discoverable next to other
 * mod-loader metadata. The file is empty; only its presence matters. We
 * deliberately do NOT read its contents because content gives us a way to
 * mis-parse and accidentally NOT honor the opt-out.</p>
 *
 * <p>An alternative would have been a JSON key inside fabric.mod.json /
 * mods.toml. We rejected that because it requires per-loader handling and
 * the parser surface is bigger; a single sentinel file is foolproof.</p>
