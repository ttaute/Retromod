/**
 * 1.3.0 track A / Phase 4 (#48): runtime edge-bridge for the {@code CompoundTag -> ValueOutput /
 * ValueInput} save-data refactor (1.21.5 / 26.x). A 1.21.1 mod's {@code @Inject} save-data handler
 * captures a {@code CompoundTag}; the modern methods pass a {@code ValueOutput}/{@code ValueInput}
 * instead. {@link com.retromod.mixin.MixinValueIoAdapter} keeps the mod's handler body UNCHANGED
 * (still operating on a real {@code CompoundTag}) and bridges only at the edges through the two
 * methods here, so no per-instruction body rewrite (which would risk silent save corruption) is
 * needed.
 *
 * <p><b>Zero compile-time Minecraft (or SLF4J) dependency on purpose:</b> Retromod is built without
 * Minecraft on the classpath, and a per-mod embedded copy of this class (Forge/NeoForge, for JPMS
 * split-package safety) must load with only what the mod's own module can see. So every Minecraft
 * type is reached reflectively by name and every result is typed {@code Object}; the synthesized
 * handler {@code CHECKCAST}s it back to {@code CompoundTag} (a universal, always-present NBT type).
 *
 * <p><b>Fails safe:</b> every path is wrapped so that any reflection failure yields a fresh empty
 * {@code CompoundTag} (or {@code null} only if even that can't be constructed). A write handler then
 * writes into a throwaway tag and a read handler reads defaults, i.e. the feature goes inert, which
 * is exactly the current blocklist-strip behavior, never worse and never a crash.
 *
 * <p><b>Verified against the 26.2 jar (the two facts this bridge depends on):</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code TagValueOutput.buildResult()} is literally {@code getfield output; areturn} over its
 *       {@code private final CompoundTag output} accumulator, i.e. it hands back the LIVE tag that is
 *       ultimately serialized, so a write handler writing into it at {@code @At("HEAD")} persists
 *       (and coexists with vanilla's own subsequent writes into the same tag).</li>
 *   <li>{@code TagValueInput} holds its source in a single {@code private final CompoundTag input}
 *       field (the only {@code CompoundTag}-typed field on the class), so the by-type field walk
 *       below lands on the real source unambiguously.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The one thing this static analysis cannot confirm is that the concrete {@code ValueOutput}/{@code
 * ValueInput} an entity/block-entity receives at runtime is always the {@code Tag*} implementation
 * (a wrapper would take the inert fail-safe path); that last step is what an in-game save/load
 * round-trip verifies.
