 * - A method contains reflection-based calls that can't be statically analyzed
 * - Code uses invokedynamic with unknown bootstrap methods
 * - Parts of the code appear to be obfuscated
 * - The compiler couldn't fully analyze the code path
 * 
 * The JitRuntime transformer looks for this annotation and performs
