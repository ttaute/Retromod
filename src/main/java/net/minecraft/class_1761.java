/*
 * Compile-time stub for Minecraft's class_1761 (ItemGroup / CreativeModeTab).
 *
 * Exists ONLY so a Retromod class can name the MC type at compile time. The .class is
 * excluded from the production jar (see pom.xml &lt;excludes&gt;) so MC's real
 * {@code class_1761} wins at runtime - same compile-only-stub trick as the @Mod stubs.
 *
 * Used as the return type of {@link com.retromod.shim.api.fabric.embedded.FabricItemGroupBuilderShim#build}
 * (#57).
