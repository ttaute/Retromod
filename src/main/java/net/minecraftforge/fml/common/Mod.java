/*
 * Retromod - compile-time stub of net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Bownlux. MIT License.
 *
 * This is NOT a copy of Forge's Mod annotation. It exists only so that
 * com.retromod.core.RetromodForge compiles without Forge on the build
 * classpath. Retromod is a multi-loader mod (Fabric / NeoForge / Forge)
 * that ships as a single artifact; pulling in the full Forge dep tree
 * just to resolve one annotation type would bloat the build for no real
 * gain.
 *
 * AT RUNTIME under Forge, Forge's classloader provides the REAL
 * net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod class - the one that FML's mod
 * scanner actually reads. Forge's class-loading hierarchy gets first
 * dibs on classes in its own packages, so our stub here is shadowed
 * and never used at runtime.
 *
 * Under Fabric / the standalone CLI, this class is loaded but never
 * referenced (the @Mod annotation only appears on RetromodForge,
 * which Fabric/CLI never instantiate). Dead weight, but tiny - one
 * class file, ~250 bytes.
 *
 * If you ever consider deleting this file: the compile WILL fail for
 * RetromodForge.java because it references @Mod by FQN. Either keep
 * the stub, or add a real Forge dependency to pom.xml at provided
 * scope.
